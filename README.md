## Blogging Platorm  

### Introduction:
Blogger's Place is a blogging platform web application built with Python Flask framework. While in development mode, it runs on port 1234. This project is part of my Certification in Python course with General Assembly.

### Current Version:
 This project currently uses blogs.csv file to store and access the data in csv format.It allows the user to do basic CRUD (create, read, edit and delete) operations on blog posts. There are certain features currently put in place for the aesthetics only and currently not working. (Searchbar, Like and Comment buttons.)

### Future Scopes:
In future versions of this application, I plan to introduce authentication and authorisation support for blog posts.  As well as the search, like and comment functionalities can be developed appropriately.Plans in place to move the data storage to NoSQL database in future to support scaling in production.
